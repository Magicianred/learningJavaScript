# Learning JavaScript Journey!

Follow along my journey trying to figure out JavaScript! Until now, I took 2 courses to learn about the basics (links below!) and now I am on my way to the third one, working with some OOP!

# My Roadmap (for Front-End Dev)
- [X] Syntax
- [X] Basic Constructs
- [ ] Dom Manipulation
- [ ] Fetch API/AJAX
- [ ] Modular JS
- [ ] Understand the concepts: Hoisting, Event Bubbling, Scope, Prototype, Shadow DOM.
